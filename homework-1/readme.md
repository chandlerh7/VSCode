## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are typically informational and are expected to be browsed by the viewer(s). Also, they are supposed to be simple and easy for users to engage with. On the otherhand, web applications focus on personalized experiences and interactions. Examples of websites are BBC News and the IUI website. Examples of web apps are Google Docs and Temu.



### VS Code & Extensions

VS Code stands for Visual Studio Code and in order for it to properly work, you have to install it on your desktop device. In this course, we will use three extensions which are Prettier, Live Server, and Auto Rename Tag.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

In order to get Git, you have to install Git and signup a GitHub account. The installation process for Windows users and Mac Users is different, sometimes Mac Users will have to use the sudo command. Git Push & Pull is where I will sync the code on GitHub and my laptop, but in order to do so I will have to make a commit. 

### Markdown & Documentation

After reviewing the markdown basics, I now understand what markdowns are and why they are important. A markdown is a lightweight markup language that is designed to format plain text which can be easily converted to HTML. Markdowns are comprised of simple symbols and characters such as headers, italics, bold, lists, etc which can be easy for the person coding to remember.
