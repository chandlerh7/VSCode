## Field Trip Project
### Project Summary 
For this project, I will be focusing on the Coyote, who is the creator of all, a spiritual being, and a trickster. The artifact that will be used is from the Eiteljorg Museum, it is a painting by Harry Fonseca titled "Coyote and Snow," which was painted in 1979. The description of this painting inspired me, it mentioned details about the Coyote, such as him providing teachings to the world, being a trickster, a spiritual being, and a character that is mentioned in folktales. Initially, the Coyote's appearance caught my attention, he seems as if he is an important figure in Native American culture.

Since I am focusing this project on the Coyote, the website will be allow users to listen to short stories and view symbolic art such as totem poles, carvings, pantings, etc; they will be able to click on each item to learn more about them. Then, the user will be able to create their own folklore and artwork, they will be able to share them to their social media platforms, send to their contacts, and/or send a copy to themselves.
