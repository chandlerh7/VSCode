## Field Trip Project
### Project Summary 
For this project I will be focusing on the Coyote, who is the creator of all, a spiritual being, and a trickster. The artifact that will be using is from the Eiteljorg Museum, it is a painting by Harry Fonseca titled "Coyote and Snow" which was painted in 1979. The description of this painting inspired me, it mentioned details about the Coyote such as him providing teachings to the world, being a trickster, a spiritual being, and a charcter that is mentioned in folktales. Initally, The Coyote's appearance caught my attention, he seemed as if he was an important figure in Native American culture. While looking at the Coyote, I noticed that he is almost taller than all of the trees and is wearing clothes to keep himself warm during the winter's harsh temperatures.  
### Core Webpages
This webpage would consist of only two pages. The first page will be a start page where the users can press "start now" to begin the experience. Also, this page will have a description of the website and instructions on what to do. 
### Design Choices 
To showcase the Coyote's changes over time, there will be a slide bar where the user can slide left to right and/or right to left to see the changes of the Coyote.
