## Field Trip Project
### Project Summary 
For this project I will be using The Coyote who is the Creator. The Coyote is considered a spirtual being who created the world and provides teachings to all. Using The Coyote, there will be an interactive website that shows The Coyote over time and how the Native American people's believes change over time. The Coyote will appear big, strong, and powerful, but over time its appearance will change due to the change that happens within the Native American community.
