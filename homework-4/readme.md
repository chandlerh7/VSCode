## Week 4

### Weekly Recap
This week I learned a lot about DOM Manipulation, Arrays & Loops. In regards to DOM Manipulation, I learned the difference between textContent, innerText, and innerHTML. I also learned that you can change the CSS with DOM Manipulation. In regards to arrays, I learned that they are used in common situations such as keeping track of scores in a game, storing a list of names in a contact book, and more. Lastly, I learned the differences between for, while, and do...while loops and that loops can be used through arrays.
