## Week 2

### Weekly Recap

This week I learned a lot more about browser console and data types & scripts. In regards to browser console, I learned a shortcut on how to pull up the console on my laptop which is: Ctrl + Shift + J. Also, I learned about the various console methods and why they are used which can be to highlight potential issues, identify important issues, track how often a code snippet executes, etc. In regards to data types & scripts, I learned about strings, numbers, boolean values, and inline vs external scripts.
